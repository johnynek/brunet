ACIS C# Coding Convention
 
1. Introduction
    This guideline aims to be a note for coding in some specific cases instead of a complete reference. Also, the convention listed here doesn't necessarily comply with the recommendations from other C# convention articles.
2. Indention 
    Use 2 Spaces instead of Tabs 
3. Comments 
   1. Block (multiple lines starts with /** for /*) and C Style (/* */): general descriptions and classes, methods descriptions 
   2. Single Line (//): recommended for commenting out code
   3. Documentation: doxygen comments prefered.  Use "///" to start a one line comment, /** to start a multiple line documentation containing comment.
4. Declarations 
   {place holder}
5. Statements 
   {place holder}
6. Naming Conventions:
   There are four formats used:
     a. PascalCase: FirstLetterCapitalized
     b. unix: all_lower_case_with_underscores_seperating_words
     c. underscore: _unix_naming_with_a_leading_underscore
     d. capitalized: UNIX_NAMING_WITH_CAPITAL_LETTERS
     e. CamelCase: firstLetterLowerAllOthersUpper

   1. Class/Namespaces/Methods/Properties: PascalCase (following the C# standard library: http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/x2dbyw72(VS.71).aspx ).
   2. Local variables: unix
   3. Const and static readonly: capitalized
   4. Instance and class variables: underscore
   5. Method Parameters: CamelCase
   6. Hungarian notations (i.e. strName) is generally considered deprecated but still allowed here for some local variables.

7. New Lines and Braces
   1. Open brace on new line for types (classes, namespaces, structs, etc)
   2. Open brace on the same line for methods, anonymous methods, control blocks
   3. "else", "catch", "finally", etc on the same line of the previous close brace.
